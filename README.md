# userInteraction
I have created a GitHub repository focusing on user interactions in Kotlin. In this project, I explore sending message with the ability to add buttons to the SnackBar messages. Additionally, I have learned how to use dialogs to send messages, incorporating both positive and negative buttons for a more interactive user experience.
